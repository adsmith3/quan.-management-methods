This notebook contains the R-script code for asasignment 9. Specifically, the The purpose of this assignment is to explore integer programming formulations and solutions. I have set it up using the traditional LP model via lpsolveAPI.

***

If you have not yet installed the lpSolveAPI, use install.packages from the tools menu to do so. Or, just use the code below.

* Note that lines that start with # are comments. 
* At any point, use the Console to look for help about a particular function using ?. For ?make.lp() 
* To run a chunk, the executable code, select the chunk, and use the Run button above to run that chunk. There are also keyboard shortcuts you can use to run chunks.


```{r}
install.packages("lpSolveAP")
```

Now, load the library I need to do assignment 9, namely lpsolverAPI.
```{r}

library(lpSolveAPI)

```

Let us set up the formulation for the integer programming, with the ultimate task of finding a solution to the problem. 

Basic explanation of integer programming:

In integer programming by definition If only some of the variables are required to have integer values, this model is referred to as mixed integer programmming (MIP). IP problems that contain only binary variables are called binary integer programming (BIP).

The purpose of this assignment is to formulate and solve an Integer Programming problem. We need to Formulate and solve the binary integer programming (BIP) model for this problem. Binary Integer Programming (BIP in what follows) is an approach to solve a system of. linear inequalities in binary unknowns (0 or 1 in what follows). 

Problem Statement:

Consider the following activity-on-arc project network, where the 12 arcs (arrows) represent the
12 activities (tasks) that must be performed to complete the project and the network displays the order in which the activities need to be performed. The number next to each arc (arrow) is the time required for the corresponding activity. Consider the problem of finding the longest path (the largest total time) through this network from start (node 1) to finish (node 9), since the longest path is the critical path. 
 
Our deliveriables, as stated by Dr. Wu:  
 
The assignment will help you with the following module outcomes:
. Formulate and solve different types of network models.
. Analyze various network models.
. Identify models that satisfy the Integer Programming (IP) model assumptions.
. Examine the solution approach to solving IP problems.
. Solve IP problems.

The are 9 nodes to this assignment. Dij refers to the duration that an activity takes to complete it from node i to node j. ESij is the earliest start time to from node i to node j. EFij refers to the earliest time to finish an activity and is calculated as ESij + Dij = EFij. The duration times are given by:

D12 = 5
D13 = 3
D25 = 3
D25 = 2
D58 = 2
D57 = 6
D24 = 4
D46 = 1
D47 = 4
D79 = 4
D69 = 5
D89 = 7

If we assume the largest time to start the next activity, the the following (ESij,Dij,EFij) will occur:

(ES13,D13,EF13) = (0,3,3)
(ES35,D35,EF35) = (3,3,6)
(ES12,D12,EF12) = (0,5,5)
(ES25,D25,EF25) = (5,2,7)
(ES58,D58,EF58) = (7,2,9) (take the larger of 6 or 7)
(ES89,D89,EF89) = (9,7,16) (completes path 1, time to complete project = 16)
(ES24,D24,EF24) = (5,4,9)
(ES46,D46,EF46) = (9,1,10)
(ES69,D69,EF69) = (10,5,15) (completes path 2, time to complete project = 15)
(ES57,D57,EF57) = (7,6,13)
(ES47,D47,EF47) = (9,4,13) (take the larger of 13 or 13, hence it does not matter)
(ES79,D79,EF79) = (13,4,17) (completes path 3, time to complete project = 17)

Therefore, the critical (longest path) is given by two separate path of activities (nodes):

1 - 2 - 4 - 7 - 9 or
1 - 2 - 5 - 7 - 9

The following is the initial program and its r-script that Dr. Wu placed in the Blackboard shell so that I can understand the concepts with formulating and solving this this problem.

```{r}

## create IP object
cpm.ip <- make.lp(nrow = 6, ncol = 7) # nrow is the number of nodes, ncol is the numnber of arcs

# create names for nodes and arcs
arc.names <- c("x12", "x13", "x23", "x35", "x34", "x45", "x56")
node.names <- c("node1", "node2", "node3", "node4", "node5", "node6")

# rename the IP object
rownames(cpm.ip) <- node.names
colnames(cpm.ip) <- arc.names

## obj function
time <- c(9, 6, 0, 8, 7, 10, 12)
set.objfn(cpm.ip, -1*time)  # default is min

## set constraints LHS
set.row(cpm.ip, 1, c(1, 1), indices = c(1, 2) )     # node 1 (starting node)
set.row(cpm.ip, 2, c(1, -1), indices = c(1, 3))     # node 2 (intermediate node)
set.row(cpm.ip, 3, c(1, 1, -1, -1), indices = c(2, 3, 4, 5))  # node 3 (intermediate node)
set.row(cpm.ip, 4, c(1, -1), indices = c(5, 6))     # node 4 (intermediate node)
set.row(cpm.ip, 5, c(1, 1, -1), indices = c(4, 6, 7))         # node 5 (intermediate node)
set.row(cpm.ip, 6, 1, indices = 7)  # node 6 (finish node)

## set constraints type
set.constr.type(cpm.ip, rep("="), 6)

## set constraint RHS
rhs <- c(1, rep(0, 4), 1)
set.rhs(cpm.ip, rhs)

## set all variables type to be binary
set.type(cpm.ip, 1:7, "binary")

## solve the IP problem
solve(cpm.ip)

get.objective(cpm.ip)        
# get objective value

get.variables(cpm.ip)        
# get values of decision variables

get.constraints(cpm.ip)      
# get constraint RHS values

```
Great, it works, although when I reconstructed the original problem and its initial network was extremely different than the one that we were assigned. Note, I am ready to apply the logic to the present assignment.

Critical Path in Project Plan Networ Concepts:

The successful management of large projects, be they construction, transportation, or financial, relies on careful scheduling and coordinating of various tasks. Critical Path Method (CPM) attempts to analyze project scheduling. 

This allows for better control and evaluation of the project. For example, we want to know how long will the project take? When will we be able to start a particular task? If this task is not completed on time, will the entire project be delayed? Which tasks should we speed up (crash) in order to finish the project earlier?

Given a network of activities, the first problem of interest is to determine the length of time required to complete the project and the set of critical activities that control the project completion time. 

Suppose that in a given project activity network there are m nodes, n arcs (i.e. activities) and an estimated duration time, Cij, associated with each arc (i to j) in the network. The beginning node of an arc corresponds to the start of the associated activity and the end node to the completion of an activity. 

To find the Critical Path (CP), define the binary variables Xij, where Xij = 1 if the activity i j is on the CP and Xij = 0 otherwise. The length of the path is the sum of the duration of the activities on the path. The length of the longest path is the shortest time needed to complete the project. 

Formally, the CP problem is to find the longest path from node 1 to node m.

Each arc has two roles: it represents an activity and it defines the precedence relationships among the activities. Sometimes it is necessary to add arcs that only represent precedence relationships. These dummy arcs are represented by dashed arrows. In our example, the arc from 2 to 3 represents a dummy activity.

The first constraint says that the project must start. For each intermediate node, if we ever reach it we have to leave that node. Finally, the last constraint enforces the completion of the project.


Running the LP formulation on any LP solver, the critical path is:

From node 1 to 2
From node 2 to 4
From node 4 to 7
From node 7 to 9

The duration of the project is, therefore 17 time units, which is what I determined by the old-fashioned hand method.

The soution is 17 (I multipled the ojective coefficents by -1 to treat this LP problem as a default miminization problem. However, I left the code to convert this problem as a maximization problem as a comment statement (i.e., p.control(cpm.ip,sense="max").

The objective function is min z = -5x12 - 3x13 - 3x35 - 2x58 - 6x57 - 2x25 - 4x24 - 4x47 - 1x46 -  4x79 - 5x69 - 7x89

The last line were the RHS coefficients or capcities for this LP problem.
