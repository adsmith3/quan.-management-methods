God help an old man get the problem solved!

```{r}
install.packages("lpSolveAP")
```

Now, load the library we need to do assignment 4.
```{r}
library(lpSolveAPI)

```

***
Let us set up the Weigelt Corporation problem. Note that we have 9 decision variables, and 11 constraints.
In the first formulation, we will directly create the objective function and constraints.
I used the formulation that I already turned in for assignment 2.

X1 = total production of large units/day at Plant 1
X2 = total production of medium units/day at Plant 1
X3 = total production of small units/day at Plant 1
X4 = total production of large units/day at Plant 2 
X5 = total production of medium units/day at Plant 2
X6 = total production of small units/day at Plant 2
X7 = total production of large units/day at Plant 3 
X8 = total production of medium units/day at Plant 3
X9 = total production of small units/day at Plant 3

LP formulation for this problem:

We have only 3 plants, but there are 3X3 combinations (large, medium, small sizes)

Max Z = 420X1 + 360X2 + 300X3 + 420X4 + 360X5 + 300X6 + 420X7 + 360X8 + 300X9

                            1/750(1X1 + 1X2 + 1X3) - 1/450(1X7 + 1X8 + 1X9) = 0
            and, Xij >= 0, (X1>=0, X2>=0, X3>=0, X4>=0. X5>=0, X6>=0, X7>=0, X8>=0, X9>=0)

    

```{r}
# make an lp object with 11 constraints (rows) and 9 (colums) decision variables
lprec <- make.lp(11, 9)
# Now create the objective function. The default is a minimization problem. 
set.objfn(lprec, c(420, 360, 300,420,360,300,420,350,300))
# As the default is a minimization problem, we change the direction to set maximization
lp.control(lprec,sense='max')
# Add the three Plant capacity constraints by large, medium, & small sizes
# First set of constraints are for Plant 1
add.constraint(lprec, c(1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), "<=", 750)

add.constraint(lprec, c(20, 15, 12, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), "<=", 13000)
add.constraint(lprec, c(0, 0, 0, 20, 15, 12, 0, 0, 0), "<=", 12000)

# To avoid layoffs, management must must use the same % of its excess capacity
# by large, medium, & small sizes
add.constraint(lprec, c(1/750, 1/750, 1/750, -1/900, -1/900, -1/900, 0, 0, 0), "<=", 0)
add.constraint(lprec, c(1/750, 1/750, 1/750, 0, 0, 0, -1/450, -1/450, -1/450), "<=", 0)
# Set bounds for variables.
# Remember that all variables had to be non-negative. We don't need to to do it here, as that is the default,
# we can set bounds explicitly
set.bounds(lprec, lower = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), columns = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)) #Not really needed but I will do it anyway.
# To identify the variables and constraints, we can create labels for the columns (variables)
# and rows (constraints)
# set variable names and name the constraints by way of function
RowNames <- c("Plant1_excess_capacity", "Plant2_excess_capacity", "Plant3_excess_capacity","Plant1_in-progess_storage", "Plant2_in-progress_storage", "Plant3_excess_storage", "Plant1_sales_forecast", "Plant2_sales_forecast", "Plant3_sales_forecast", "Layoff_prevention_Plant1_&_Plant2", "Layoff_prevention_Plant_1_&_Plant3", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint", "non-negativity_constraint")
ColNames <- c("Product1_large_sizes", "Product1_medium_sizes", "Plant1_small_sizes", "Plant2_large_sizes", "Plant2_medium sizes", "Plant2_small_sizes", "Plant3_large_sizes", "Plant_3_medium_sizes", "Plant3_small_sizes")
dimnames(lprec) <- list(RowNames, ColNames)
# Now, print out the model
lprec
# The model can also be saved to a file
write.lp(lprec, filename = "Weigelt_Corporation_problem", type = "lp")

```

We now solve the above LP problem
```{r}
solve(lprec)
```

The output above doesn't indicate that the answer is 0, but that there was a successful solution
We now output the value of the objective function, and the variables
```{r}
get.objective(lprec)
get.variables(lprec)
```

The solution shows that the profit is $698,000, with the first variable value equal to 516.6667, the second variable value equal to 177.7778, the thrid variable value equal to 0, the fourth variable value equal to 0, the fifth variable value equal to 533.3333, the sixth variable value equal to 333.3333, the seventh variable value equal to 0, the eighth variable value equal to 0, and the ninth variable value equal to 416.6667.
One difficulty in reading the output is that lpsolveAPI will not write the variable name next to the solution. As such, one should remember that the variables values are output in the order in which it shows up in the lp formulation. 

To add the variable names and solutions:

Max profit = $698,000

X1 = total production of large units/day at Plant 1 = 516.6667 (516.7 units)
X2 = total production of medium units/day at Plant 1 = 177.7778 (177.8 units)
X3 = total production of small units/day at Plant 1 = 0.0 (none)
X4 = total production of large units/day at Plant 2 = 0.0  (none)
X5 = total production of medium units/day at Plant 2 = 533.3333 (533.3 units)
X6 = total production of small units/day at Plant 2 = 333.3333 (333.3 units)
X7 = total production of large units/day at Plant 3  = 0.0 (none)
X8 = total production of medium units/day at Plant 3 = 0.0 (none)
X9 = total production of small units/day at Plant 3 = 416.6667 (416.7 units)






Before we look at other output values, let us consider using a different method to input the problem formuation. We will use the lp format by creating a text file that contains the Weigelt problem formulation. We also outputted an lp file using the write.lp statement above.
Please now look at the adsmith3_Assignment4.lp file. In RStudio, you can double click on the file in the Files list on the right pane.

***

We now read the lp formulation using an lp file. To read about about the lp format for files, you can read the documentation at http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/lp-format.htm. 
```{r}
write.lp(lprec, filename = "Weigelt_Corporation_problem", type = "lp")
x <- read.lp(filename = "Weigelt_Corporation_problem", type = "lp") 
# create an lp object x
x                          
# display x               

```

Solve the lp model
```{r}
solve(x)
get.objective(x)        # get objective value
get.variables(x)        # get values of decision variables
get.constraints(x)      # get constraint RHS values
```

If you run all the chunks above, you can display the text, code, and output in an html file. Click on the 4.1-WBC.nb.html file in your directory from withing RStudio.

You can also get the output in word, or pdf form by knitting the output. Use the Knit Document option from the File menu, or use the drop down menu from the Preview option above. 

```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
